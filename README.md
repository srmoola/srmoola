### Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

<p align="center">I'm currently a Computer Engineering student @ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and a part-time Software Developer @ FIA. I'm passionate about areas of machine learning like deep learning and reinforcement learning:man_technologist:. You can also find me interested in robotics :robot: and how we can use deep learning to automate these robots. I've started exploring the field of electronics as well âœ¨ and hope to contribute to that field as well.
